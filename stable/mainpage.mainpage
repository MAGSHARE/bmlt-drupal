	<h1>INSTALLATION</h1>
	You unzip the bmlt.zip file, and place the resulting "bmlt" directory into your Drupal sites/all/modules/ directory. If the directory does not already exist, you should create it.
	
	You then need to activate the block, and/or activate the input filter (which replaces
	&lt;!--BMLT--&gt; with the BMLT implementation).
	
	In order to use the filter, you need to set up an input format at Administer &gt; Site Configuration &gt; Input Formats &gt;
	
	You need to specify an input format that uses the BMLT Inline filter.
	
	The BMLT filter is called "BMLT Inline", and works by replacing inline HTML &lt;!--BMLT--&gt; with the BMLT.
	Just write a page or story, select the BMLT Inline input format for that page, and add that HTML to it.
	At that point, you will get a BMLT instance.
    
    This file is part of the Basic Meeting List Toolbox (BMLT).
